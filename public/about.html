<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Tanish Chavan, but you can call me Teezy or Tan!
   I’m a 20-year-old B.Tech student currently diving into the world of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). 
   I'm passionate about technology, from coding to machine learning, and am always learning something new to expand my skills.</p>

<p>When I’m not studying, you’ll find me exploring the world—whether that’s traveling,
   trying out new fashion trends, or enjoying the latest NBA games.
    I also have a huge love for bikes, cars, and perfumes. 
    I’m into fitness too, aiming to balance my studies with staying healthy and active.</p>

<p>I’m on a journey to figure out my path, with my sights set on freelancing,
   internships, and some big personal goals—like learning full-stack development,
    mastering data structures and algorithms, and eventually cracking the GATE exam.
     Oh, and I’m also working on getting my abs and scooty skills by year-end!</p>
