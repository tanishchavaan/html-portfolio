       <h2>My top 3 movies of 2024</h2>
       <hr/>
       <h3>Maharaja</h3>
       <p>Best tamil film I have seen in a long time I was as much awed by the suspense and twists as I was while watching Kahani  sethupathi given terrific performance intervel bang climax was most distrubing when I watch vikram vedha by Vijay Sethupati and R Madhwan never forget that movie üçø became fan of his acting üé≠ Absolute masterpiece cannot remember such brilliant acting in any other Indian cinema except Prithivi's in Jana Gana Mana Anurag's acting at the climax shook me This is god level acting</p>
       <h3>Mangalavaaram</h3>
       <p>"Mangalavaaram" (2023)* is a visually arresting and thematically rich Indian horror thriller that delves into the darker aspects of human nature, set against the backdrop of a rural village in the 1990s. Directed by Ajay Bhupathi, the film blends horror, folklore, and social commentary to create an unsettling yet thought-provoking experience.</p>
       <h3>8 Mile</h3>
       <p>"8 Mile" is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA, not an action. I hope you go see this movie if your in for a good story with some great characters!</p>
